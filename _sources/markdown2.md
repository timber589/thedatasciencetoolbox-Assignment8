# Part 2b - Overall thoughts on the course

Overall feedback on this course:
The course started out promising when learning how to install packages onto a local computer and learning how to use Github to work collaboratively on data science projects.
```{margin}
"I was very much looking forward to this course to give me a toolkit to truly being my data science journey but I don't feel this course gave me the framework and knowledge necessary to get started"
```
However, inconsistent marking and the lack of examples tying the course to actual data science projects has been disappointing. I found that the instructors made this course inconsistent with the other courses within the data science curriculum in the Extended Learning library of courses.

Perhaps if they tied in more data science into the course to enforce why items such as block math equations were necessary, it would have been a more effective teaching method. For example, within the assignments, after having only "instructed" very rudimentary LaTeX math equations, assignments requested that students go to an only repository and learn how to write complex math equations which hasn't yet told me why these equations are necessary or why I should care about these equations in data science. It would have been a completely different story had the course described that math equations are used by data scientists to calculate the statistical nature of the data they are looking to analyze and examples of common equations used be data scientists are X,Y,Z. Aspiring data scientists need to familiarize themselves with these formulas etc...

It's easy enough to write block math equations such as:

$$ 1\times 1 = 1 $$

$$ 2\times 2 = 4 $$

I wish that I had more inspiration for this assignment but I don't have a data science project that could prove as inspiration. Perhaps this course should recommend that the students go to kaggle and work with a dataset there for this final assignment.

Perhaps the Titanic data set?

Thank you for the course. I hope to see an improved version in future audits of the course information
